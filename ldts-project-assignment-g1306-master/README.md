# Donkey Kong Game

A giant gorilla named Donkey Kong kidnapped Pauline.
Marios' goal is to ascend across all platforms and rescue the princess.

## Game Description

The player (Mario) will start from the bottom of the screen.
As said before, his goal is to achieve the top and rescue Pauline.

Donkey Kong is going to try everything he can to stop Mario, such as throwing wood barrels and fireballs at him.
These obstacles can kill the player, so, to dodge them, the player can jump over them or destroy them with the hammer.

To ascend in the game, the player will have to move between platforms.
There are two possible ways for that: use the stairs or jump from one to another (if possible). Once Mario gets to the top and reaches Pauline, the player wins.

## Features

Mario does not start with his hammer, he will be able to catch it at some point in the game.

In addition to saving Pauline, the player has a goal, to complete the level with the maximum points.
Points are awarded from the following: destroying objects with the hammer, jumping over obstacles, and completing the level in the shortest time possible.
A leaderboard is displayed with the menu.
